Provide hyperlinks for plain text urls.

Based on this regex by John Gruber: http://daringfireball.net/2009/11/liberal_regex_for_matching_urls

From the link:

"It makes no attempt to parse URLs according to any official specification. It isnâ€™t limited to predefined URL protocols. It should be clever about things like parentheses and trailing punctuation."
